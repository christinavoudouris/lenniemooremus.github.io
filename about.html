						at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music.
					</p>
					<p>
						Lennie Moore began composing at an early age. “I remember being about 4 or 5 years old, sitting at the piano, with my mother transcribing on music paper for me, as I was plunking out a melody and saying things like ‘I want that note!’”
					</p>
					<p>
						Lennie studied writing in his teens with jazz icons Toshiko Akiyoshi, Julian Priester, and Kim Richmond. At Berklee College of Music he completed his Bachelor of Music in Jazz Composition degree, studying with outstanding faculty Herb Pomeroy, David Mash, Ken Pullig, Barrie Nettles, Bob Freedman and Michael Gibbs. While living in Los Angeles, he studied orchestral conducting for 6 years under renowned teacher, William Kettering, who learned his craft from the conducting lineage of Leon Barzan and Arturo Toscanini.

						“Aside from the fact that Lennie is a brilliant composer, aside from
						the fact that he works quickly, efficiently, and with the utmost
						level of professionalism, aside from fact that he's extremely
						experienced and knows how to tackle whatever you throw at him -
						aside from all of those things, Lennie Moore is the perfect guy to
						have in the trenches with you."
					</p>
					<p>
						"You need someone with a 'can do' attitude? Hire Lennie. You want a
						brilliant composer whose persistent optimism is infectious? Hire
						Lennie. You want someone who will pitch in with whatever needs to be
						done without the slightest hesitation? Hire Lennie. Hire Lennie for
						all of these reasons, but at the bare minimum hire Lennie because
						your project will be better off for it.”

						“Lennie had so many fun ideas for the movie. He found a sound
						palette that gave the film a modern day messiah feel, which is
						exactly what we needed. He has a great ear and a gift for telling
						stories with music. Lennie is a collaborator, fast, technically
						profound and fun to hang out with. Now when people watch the film
						they always remark on how fantastic the music is.”

						“I have worked with Lennie for years. He has done outstanding
						orchestrating, conducting and composing for my company. But, be
						careful......he steals cookies.”
					</p>
					<p><strong>Jeff Koz, HUM Music and Sound Design</strong></p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>
						“We hired Lennie to write symphonic music for our game Outcast in
						1997. I was looking for someone who could handle all the music
						production aspects from composing to hiring the soloists and
						orchestra and organise recording sessions. And the result was
						outstanding, way beyond my expectations. I'm a film music lover, so
						I had strong references in my mind and all I can say is Lennie was
						up to the task. The music was inspirational, the orchestration
						filled with rich articulations and great themes, the recording
						quality was top notch, and the most important thing, the music fit
						so well into the game's universe. Looking back at the game today
						makes me smile because the graphics look so dated. But if there is
						one thing that still stands up against any of today's next gen
						blockbusters, it is Lennie's wonderful score.”

						“Lennie is the best. Call him and know that all your musical needs
						will be taken care of! His skills, versatility and personality
						combine to make this the easiet decision you will make.”

						“Lennie did a terrific job for me on a project for the BBC a few
						years back. Lennie is a complete musician as well as techno-expert,
						and I would have total confidence working with him in any situation:
						film, tv, videogames, "live" music (all styles), etc. I look forward
						to working with him again.”

						“It doesn’t get any better than SWTOR when it comes to audio with
						hundreds of hours of professionally recorded dialogue (including
						alien dialects), fantastic sound effects, and a dynamic soundtrack
						that will ramp up during combat then slip away leaving you only with
						environmental effects for the more exploratory parts of the game.”

						“Audio is another home-run for the game all around. As we’ve come to
						expect from Bioware, the voice acting is top notch and the game is
						scored by a full orchestra -- complete with ominous chanting choirs
						to create that tension filled Star Wars style music that does so
						well with lightsaber fights.”

						“The film [Watchmen Motion Comic] is especially benefitted by a
						musical score from Lennie Moore...especially evocative in the
						breathtaking “Watchmaker” episode, where it thrusts its dramatic,
						epic atmosphere beneath the narration as Jon, Dr. Manhattan, weaves
						his timeless and timeshifting tale. Moore gives the story much of
						its emotive vitality and expressiveness, aided by the voice
						performance and sound effects.”

						“Perhaps one of the most crucial aspects of a game that can make or
						break its immersion value lies in its music and sound. Outcast
						achieves near perfection on both. The musical score is breathtaking;
						surpassing the quality of most movies and games I have seen in the
						past few years. Appeal went all out. The music is composed and
						orchestrated by Lennie Moore, and performed by the Moscow Symphony
						Orchestra and Chorus. One welcome feature is the seamless transition
						of music from scene to scene. If you're taking a Sunday stroll
						around the village, a pleasantly calm but moving score accompanies
						you. Encounter an enemy, and the battle music begins.”
					</p>
					<p><strong>John Wooldridge</strong></p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>
						“The musical score and sound effects of Outcast were probably the
						least hyped aspect of the game, however, they are probably the
						elements which stand out the most. The background music that
						accompanies you throughout your adventure is composed by the Moscow
						Symphony Orchestra, and is the best we have ever heard.”
